## Planned Tasks

- [x] Review old code and figure out where I last ended
- [x] Test new motor to see if it works and how powerful the thrust is compared to old motor with 3D printed propellers
- [x] Look into the L293D and specifically how the output voltage works
- [x] Look into circuit design


## New Motor and L293D 

L293D: [L293x Quadruple Half-H Drivers datasheet (Rev. D)](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293.pdf)

- L293D output voltage is typically the input VCC_2 - 1.4V
- Using a power supply module to convert 12V into 5V, VCC_2 and VCC_1 were tested to be 4.99-5V
- However, with pin 15 (4A) being set to high with ~1.5V from the ESP32, the output pin 14 (4Y) was also 4.99V 
- Additionally, even when setting the power supply to 3.3V and testing the 4A output to be ~2.5-3V, the new motor did not turn on
	- This is probably due to an insufficient current
	- Attaching the motor directly to the power strips does turn it on at 2.5V

Motor:
- Thrust is significantly higher than the older motor with printed propellers, even with a smaller weight

This L283D module may not be fit for my application, going to transition towards looking into past projects to learn what other people do for DC motors

**Notes**
- Most projects use prebuilt modules and sets for the user to assemble
- All projects use some sort of diode + MOSFET combination to control the DC motors
- \[2] Has a very in depth explanation on PID and a DIY flight controller
- \[1] Has a simple circuit for motor control with Schottky diodes and N-type MOSFETs 
- All projects use a specific battery chosen for their circuit and needs

**Outcomes**
- I will need to look into specifications for each component I'm using to find the best battery
- I will need to have circuit protections to isolate the ESP32 line and motor line to prevent noise and damage to the electronics
- I will need to look into a different module to control the motors, probably MOSFETs downstream of the motors
- Bluetooth will probably work for now since the drone won't be flown far initially



## Motor Speed Control

**Diode**: Two options: silicone diode vs. Schottky diode
- Plan on using Schottky diode as it has a fast switching time and low forward voltage
- The fast switching time is essential when the motor will be constantly switched through PWM

**MOSFET**: Currently planning on using N-type MOSFET
- Needs a heat sink from drain


## Battery

**Voltage**: Stick with 3.7V as the motors are rated for 3.7V
- Can use a buck-boost converter to lower to 3.3V for the flight controller

**Current Rating**: XXC
- Maximum current that a battery can handle at once
- This should be calculated by the maximum peak or surge current that my components will produce (e.g. motor stall current)

**Milliamp Hours**
- Calculated using Current Draw \* Operating Hours
- Find the total current draw of all components, add a safety factor, and calculate

This specification research and calculations are documented in the [PCB v1.0 section](#version_PCB-v1_0).
